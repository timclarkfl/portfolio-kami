title: Goals as a Frontend developer
---
I have thought long and hard about what I want out of this coding bootcamp and beside the obvious answer of getting a job to support my family I realized through the process that I want to be challenged, I want to find something that makes me have to get better every day, but mostly I want something that makes me feel when I go to bed that night that I didnt just sleepwalk through my day and I created something that is truly helpful in the world. But to achieve this my first goal is to learn the following things:


HTML & CSS

Learning this most basic building block inside and out will be vital to acheive my goals. 

JavaScript

Ah Javascript you beautiful beast. Since I began this journey I have spent more nights with you than my wife (love you honey!). To become a real front end ninja I must master this language. 

jQuery

JavaScript Frameworks

Responsive and Mobile Design

Testing and Debugging

Git and Version Control Systems

GIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTT! This is my everest. This is nemesis. Being able to master this is where I either succeed or fail. 

Problem Solving Skills

If there’s one thing that all front end developers have to have, regardless of the job description or official title, it’s excellent problem solving skills. This is wheredevelopment becomes more than a job to me. I love problem solving. But I have learned quite quickly that just loving to problem solve isnt enough. You must have the basic knowledge and skills to even know what problem you are trying to solve. But once those skills are in place I should excel at this part. 

Once I have learned, if not, mastered the things listed above I believe my larger, more macro goals, will be achieved day in and day out. Its a grind everyday but I have learned quickly that I have come to love that grind and look forward to it everyday.
