## Explanation

BlocChat was my first foray into the world of Angular on my own (kind of). My hope is as my skill set becomes more substantial I can revisit this and not only see where I have come from but improve upon this chatroom program and prove my mentor wrong (thanks a million Junior).

## Problem

Figuring out how to use Angular correctly while at the same time creating a website that functioned correctly. 

## Solution

After many, many , many, many revision the final product is a workable version but not quite to the design level and functionality i am hoping to achieve down the road. 



## Conclusion

I tend to overthink things as programming in general is so very new to me that I get myself down some rabbit holes and it takes a while to find my way out. I am learning, albeit slowly to trust what I have learned and apply it how I was taught. While doing this project I learned to lean on my support system and to trust my gut instincts when approaching problem soving.
